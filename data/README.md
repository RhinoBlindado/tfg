# `data`
## Information
- Used to store data for the networks, not strictly necessary but all the scripts reference this folder.
- Two subfolders: `datasets` where the actual datasets are stored in their own folder and `original` that contains the raw files.
- The `Nodule-50-30K` and `Nodule-98-30K` datasets are unavailable due to a confidentiality agreement with the University of Granada.
- The `SHREC16` and `SphereCubes` datasets are available to be used, and are located in the `datasets` folder in ZIPs files that need to be decompressed before use.
